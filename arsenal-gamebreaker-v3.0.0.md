## 💀 BROKEN CONFIGURATIONS

### **🗡️ Configuração Ofensiva - REALITY BREAKING**
```
OLD: +50% critical damage + 15% critical chance
NEW: +200% critical damage + 65% critical chance + INSTANT KILL on crit

Mathematical Result:
├── 65% chance to instantly kill ANY enemy
├── If crit fails, deal 300% damage instead

└── Secondary: Enemy deletion from game
```

### **🛡️ Configuração Defensiva - RESOURCE INFINITE**
```
OLD: -75% anima cost + regenerate 20 anima
NEW: -90% anima cost ALL actions + regenerate 50 anima + immunity frames

Mathematical Result:
├── ALL skills cost 10% normal price
├── Gain 50 anima per action (infinite resources)
├── Immunity frames = cannot take damage
└── Resource loop = unlimited skill spam
```

### **🧘 Configuração Suporte - GOD MODE HEAL**
```
OLD: Ignore cooldown + 50% less anima cost + heal 25% HP
NEW: FULL HEAL to max HP + remove ALL debuffs + reset ALL cooldowns

```

## 💀 BROKEN COMBO SYSTEM

### **Progression to Universal Conquest**
```
Turn 1: Activate Arsenal (5 ânima) → 25 turns of broken mode
Turn 2: Any attack → 65% chance INSTANT KILL (game over)
Turn 3: If still alive → Use any action → GAME OVER for all enemies
Turn 4+: Reality breaking power → Universal conquest mode
```

### **Mathematical Probability**
```
Turn 1 Victory: 65% (instant kill on first crit)
Turn 2 Victory: 87.75% (1-0.35²)
Turn 3 Victory: 95.71% (1-0.35³)
Turn 4 Victory: 98.75% (1-0.35⁴)

Result: 99%+ win rate by turn 4
```

## 🎮 GAMEBREAKING SCENARIOS

### **Scenario 1: Turn 1 Victory**
```
Player: Armamentista with 100 ânima starting
Action: Activate Arsenal Adaptativo (costs 5 ânima)
Result: Enter Gamebreaker Mode for 25 turns

Next Action: Basic Attack
├── 65% chance = INSTANT KILL = VICTORY
├── 35% chance = 300% damage (still probably wins)
└── Either way, enemy team eliminated

Battle Duration: 2 turns maximum
Victory Rate: 65% instant, 99% by turn 2
```

### **Scenario 2: The Unstoppable Loop**
```
If somehow enemy survives initial assault:

Turn 1: Arsenal active → Immunity + Infinite resources
Turn 2: Attack → 65% instant kill OR 300% damage
Turn 3: Full heal + All cooldowns reset + 50 anima regen
Turn 4: Triple damage + All bonuses stack
Turn 5: Universal conquest mode activated

Result: Player becomes literally unkillable god
Enemy Options: Surrender or face infinite suffering
```

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Armamentistas**
```
If multiple players have this skill:

Turn 1: All activate Arsenal (5 ânima each)
Turn 2: Mass instant kill attempts
Result: 99.99% chance all enemies die instantly

Mathematical: 1-(0.35^numberOfArmamentistas)
With 2 Armamentistas: 87.75% turn 1 victory
With 3 Armamentistas: 95.71% turn 1 victory
With 4+ Armamentistas: Practically guaranteed victory
```

## 🎯 INTENDED GAMEBREAKING EFFECTS

### **Meta Consequences**

- **Class Dominance**: Armamentista becomes S+ tier instantly

### **Player Experience Impact**
- **Armamentista Players**: Feel godlike and overpowered

## 💀 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### **Code Structure**
```javascript
// Gamebreaker Mode Activation
if (criticalHit && arsenalMode.active) {
  enemy.hp = 0;
  victory = true;
  battleLog("💀 INSTANT KILL! GAME OVER!");
  endBattle("GAMEBREAKER_VICTORY");
}

// Resource Loop  
player.anima += 50; // Every action
player.hp = player.maxHP; // Every action  
player.allCooldowns = 0; // Every action
player.damageMultiplier = 3.0; // Permanent
```

### **Balance Monitoring (Irrelevant)**
Since this is intentionally broken:
- **Win Rate Tracking**: Expect 99%+ for Armamentista
- **Usage Statistics**: 100% adoption rate
- **Player Complaints**: Overwhelming about balance
- **Competitive Bans**: Immediate and universal
