# terminal-fixes

**Bug Resolution Documentation Repository**

This folder contains detailed documentation of bugs that were resolved using terminal commands and external tools, without relying on AI-assisted development environments.

## 📁 Purpose

This repository serves as a **knowledge base** for:

- **Terminal-based debugging** methodologies
- **Manual fix implementations** using command-line tools
- **Root cause analysis** documentation
- **Prevention strategies** for recurring issues
- **Quick reference** for similar problems

## 🎯 Scope

### ✅ **Included:**
- Bugs resolved via **terminal/CLI commands**
- Issues fixed through **system-level configurations**
- Problems solved using **native OS tools**
- Debugging processes that required **manual intervention**

### ❌ **Not Included:**
- AI-assisted code generation fixes
- IDE-integrated automatic solutions
- Cloud-based debugging tools
- Automated deployment fixes

## 📋 Documentation Structure

Each bug report follows this standardized structure:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_bug-description/
├── README.md                    # Bug overview and quick reference
├── report-en.md                 # Detailed resolution report (English)
├── report-pt.md                 # Detailed resolution report (Portuguese)
├── commands-applied.sh          # Actual commands executed
├── logs/                        # Terminal outputs and error logs
└── prevention.md                # Future prevention strategies
```

## 📊 Categories

### 🐛 **Bug Types:**
- **Encoding Issues** - Character encoding and line ending problems
- **Configuration Errors** - Misconfigurations in build tools
- **Environment Setup** - System-level compatibility issues
- **API Connectivity** - Network and protocol-related problems
- **Package Management** - Dependency and module resolution issues

### 🛠️ **Resolution Methods:**
- Command-line utilities (`sed`, `grep`, `find`, etc.)
- System configuration changes
- Package manager operations
- File manipulation and cleanup
- Environment variable adjustments

## 🚀 How to Use

### **For Quick Fixes:**
1. Browse folder names for similar issues
2. Check `README.md` for immediate solutions
3. Copy commands from `commands-applied.sh`
4. Adapt to your specific environment

### **For Deep Understanding:**
1. Read the full `report-en.md` or `report-pt.md`
2. Study the root cause analysis
3. Review prevention strategies
4. Understand the debugging methodology

### **For Learning:**
- Compare different approaches across cases
- Understand systematic debugging processes
- Learn terminal command patterns
- Study problem-solving methodologies

## 📈 Success Metrics

Each documented case includes:

- ✅ **Resolution Time** - How long it took to fix
- ✅ **Success Rate** - Whether the fix worked completely
- ✅ **Prevention Level** - How well future occurrences are prevented
- ✅ **Reusability** - How applicable the solution is to other cases

## 🔧 Tools Commonly Used

### **System Tools:**
- `find` - File system searches
- `sed` - Text stream editing
- `grep` - Pattern matching
- `awk` - Text processing
- `sort`, `uniq` - Data manipulation

### **Development Tools:**
- `npm`, `yarn` - Package management
- `git` - Version control
- `curl`, `wget` - Network utilities
- `cat`, `less` - File viewing
- `chmod`, `chown` - Permission management

## 📚 Learning Resources

### **Referenced in Reports:**
- Man pages for terminal commands
- Official tool documentation
- Stack Overflow solutions
- GitHub issue discussions
- Technical blog posts

### **Skills Developed:**
- **Terminal proficiency** - Advanced command-line usage
- **Systematic debugging** - Methodical problem-solving
- **Root cause analysis** - Deep technical investigation
- **Documentation** - Clear technical writing
- **Prevention thinking** - Proactive problem avoidance

## 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

When adding a new case:

1. **Use consistent naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD_brief-description`
2. **Include all required files** as per the structure above
3. **Write clear, actionable commands**
4. **Document the thought process** behind the solution
5. **Add prevention strategies** to avoid recurrence
6. **Test commands** before documenting them
7. **Use generic paths** (avoid personal directory names)

## 📞 Support

This is a **self-maintained documentation repository**. Each case represents real debugging scenarios resolved through systematic terminal-based approaches.

For questions about specific cases, refer to the individual case documentation or apply the documented methodology to your specific scenario.
