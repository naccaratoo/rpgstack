## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Each RPG game development project requires creating and managing character data from scratch, leading to repetitive work in building character management systems, inconsistent data structures, and time lost on infrastructure instead of game content creation.

### Solution Overview
A standalone, deployable character database system that can be set up independently for each RPG game project, providing a complete character management interface and export functionality tailored to that specific game's needs.

### Success Metrics
- Reduce character management development time by 80% per project
- Provide consistent, reusable system architecture across projects
- Enable character database setup in under 30 minutes per new game project

## 2. Product Vision & Strategy

### Vision Statement
Provide a production-ready character database solution that eliminates the need to build character management systems from scratch for each RPG game project.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Reusability:** Create a system template that works for any RPG project
2. **Self-Contained:** Each game gets its own independent database instance
3. **Rapid Deployment:** Quick setup and customization for new projects
4. **Export Ready:** Generate game-ready data formats
