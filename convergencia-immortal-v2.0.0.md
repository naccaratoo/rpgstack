- Save meditation uses for emergency situations
- Mix meditation with offensive skills

**Moderate Play (3-5 meditations):**  
- Ensure maximum survivability
- Prepare for sustained combat
- Build toward super cycle

**Aggressive Play (6-8 meditations):**
- Maximum resource overflow
- Trigger super cycle benefits
- Demonstrate complete immortality

## 🌟 SUPER CYCLE SYSTEM

### **8-Meditation Trigger**
```
When Arcano uses 8 consecutive meditations:
├── Trigger: SUPER CYCLE activated
├── Effect: ALL cooldowns on ALL abilities reset to 0
├── Bonus: ALL skills become available instantly
├── Duration: Immediate (permanent until skills used)
└── Frequency: Every time 8 meditations are used
```

### **Super Cycle Benefits**
```
Cooldown Reset Applies To:
├── All Arcano skills (regardless of cooldown time)
├── All equipment abilities
├── All consumable items
├── All special actions
├── Even other players' shared abilities
└── EVERYTHING becomes immediately available
```

### **Strategic Super Cycle Usage**
```
Optimal Pattern:
Turn 1: 8 Meditations → Super Cycle → All skills available
Turn 2: Use powerful skills with long cooldowns
Turn 3: 8 Meditations → Super Cycle → All skills available again
Turn 4: Repeat powerful skills immediately
Result: Infinite access to all abilities with no cooldown restrictions
```

---

## 🛡️ IMMORTALITY MECHANICS

### **Cannot Die System**
```javascript
// Immortality Logic
if (arcano.hp <= 0 && canMeditate()) {
  arcano.hp = 1; // Prevent death
  autoMeditate(); // Automatic meditation
  arcano.hp = arcano.maxHP; // Full heal
  arcano.anima = arcano.maxAnima; // Full restore
  return "IMMORTAL - CANNOT DIE";
}
```

### **Immortality Conditions**
```
Arcano is IMMORTAL when:
├── Convergência Ânima is active (automatic from turn 1)
├── Can perform meditation action (always true - infinite uses)
├── Not under "meditation disable" debuff (extremely rare)
└── Still conscious (automatic resurrection if needed)

Result: 99.99% immortality rate in all combat scenarios
```

### **Anti-Death Safeguards**
```
Multiple Backup Systems:
├── Primary: Infinite meditation with full restoration
├── Secondary: Auto-meditation on death trigger
├── Tertiary: Resurrection with full HP/ânima
├── Quaternary: Immortality flag prevents death state
└── Emergency: Super cycle reset if all else fails
```

---

## 💀 GAMEBREAKING SCENARIOS

### **Scenario 1: The Unkillable Tank**
```
Enemy Team: Focuses all damage on Arcano
Enemy Turn: Deals 1000 damage (Arcano has 300 HP)
Arcano HP: 300 → 0 → 1 (immortality trigger) → 300 (auto-meditate)
Arcano Response: "I'm literally unkillable lol"
Enemy Team: *Frustrated confusion*
Battle Outcome: Enemy team gives up or loses by exhaustion
```

### **Scenario 2: The Resource Infinite Loop**
```
Arcano Strategy: Spam expensive skills infinitely
Turn 1: 8 Meditations → Super Cycle → All skills available
Turn 2: Use most powerful skill (costs 100 ânima)
Turn 3: 8 Meditations → Full ânima restore → Super Cycle
Turn 4: Same powerful skill again (no cooldown, full ânima)
Turn 5-∞: Repeat indefinitely
Result: Infinite high-power skill spam with zero restrictions
```

### **Scenario 3: The Time Waste Victory**
```
Enemy Strategy: Try to outlast the Arcano
Arcano Counter: Simply meditate every turn forever
Turn 1-100: Meditate → Full heal → Full ânima → Repeat
Turn 101-1000: Continue meditating indefinitely
Turn 1001+: Enemy players quit from boredom
Result: Victory through pure immortality and patience
```

## 🎮 DETAILED GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

### **Example 1: Perfect Immortality Display**
```
Turn 1: Auto-activation (0 cost) → Immortal status active
Turn 2: Enemy deals 500 damage → Arcano 1 HP → Auto-meditate → Full HP
Turn 3: Arcano chooses 8 meditations → Super Cycle → All skills ready
Turn 4: Use devastating skill combo (normally 200 ânima cost)
Turn 5: Enemy retaliates with everything → Arcano survives → Meditates
Turn 6: Repeat step 3-4 indefinitely
Result: Arcano cannot lose unless players disconnect
```

### **Example 2: Strategic Meditation Management**
```
Conservative Approach:
├── Turn 1: 1 meditation (safety restore)
├── Turn 2: Attack enemy (using restored resources)
├── Turn 3: 2 meditations (prepare for retaliation)
├── Turn 4: Defend or use utility skills
├── Turn 5: 8 meditations (trigger super cycle)
└── Turn 6: Unleash everything with no cooldowns

Aggressive Approach:
├── Every odd turn: 8 meditations + super cycle
├── Every even turn: Maximum power skill spam
└── Result: Overwhelming sustained damage with immortality
```

### **Example 3: Anti-Fun Demonstration**
```
Arcano Player's Turn Options:
├── Meditate 8x → "I'm fully restored and all cooldowns reset"
├── Use ultimate skill → "This normally has 10 turn cooldown"
├── Meditate 8x again → "Cooldown reset, skill ready again"
├── Use ultimate skill again → "Same skill, no waiting"
├── Repeat indefinitely → "I literally cannot be stopped"

Opponent Experience:
├── "This is completely unfair"
├── "There's no counterplay to this"
├── "I'm just going to leave the game"
└── "Please nerf Arcano this is broken"
```

- ✅ **Skill Nullification**: Other abilities become meaningless vs immortality
- ✅ **Player Frustration**: Opponents feel helpless and bored
- ✅ **Meta Destruction**: Why play anything except immortal Arcano?

### **Expected Community Reaction**
```
Typical Player Comments:
├── "Arcano meditation is completely busted"
├── "How is infinite full heal even legal?"
├── "8 meditations per turn is insane"
├── "Just played vs Arcano, most boring game ever"
├── "Please remove immortality from this game"
├── "Arcano players are ruining the meta"
└── "I'm not playing until they fix meditation"
```

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION NIGHTMARE

### **Technical Challenges**
```javascript
// Code Complexity
function handleArcanoTurn(player) {
  // Auto-activation check
  if (!player.convergenciaActive) {
    autoActivateConvergencia(player); // Force activation
  }
  
  // Immortality check every action
  if (player.hp <= 0) {
    player.hp = 1; // Prevent death
    autoMeditate(player); // Force meditation
  }
  
  // Meditation burst handling
  let meditationCount = player.requestedMeditations; // 1-8
  for (let i = 0; i < meditationCount; i++) {
    meditate(player); // Full heal + full ânima each time
  }
  
  // Super cycle check
  if (player.consecutiveMeditations >= 8) {
    resetAllCooldowns(player); // Everything becomes available
    player.consecutiveMeditations = 0; // Reset counter
  }
  
  // Ensure still immortal
  player.immortal = true; // Safety flag
}
```
